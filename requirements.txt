#  Nonlinear Fore(Back)casting and Innovation Filtering for Causal-Noncausal VAR Models
#  Professional-grade Python implementation of Gourieroux-Jasiak (2022) framework
#
#  This file specifies the exact dependency versions required for reproducible
#  execution of the mixed causal-noncausal VAR modeling framework. Version
#  constraints are based on:
#  • Numerical stability requirements for eigenvalue decomposition algorithms
#  • Computational accuracy demands for nonlinear optimization procedures
#  • Statistical robustness needs for kernel density estimation methods
#  • Parallel processing reliability for bootstrap uncertainty quantification
#
#  Installation: pip install -r requirements.txt
